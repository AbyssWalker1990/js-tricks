Definitions:
Node - container for data
Linked Lists - list of nodes that have a references

Difference with arrays:
Situation - we have array [a, b, c, d] and we need to insert element q in 2 position index
Behind the scenes when we inserting our q element - we must to shift right all elements after this position

But if we have linkes list like a -> b -> c -> d
We must only define 2 pointers from b -> q ann 1 -> c 

And with linked list it will be much faster and costs less effort
