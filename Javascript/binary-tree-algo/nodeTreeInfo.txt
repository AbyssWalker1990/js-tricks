Terms:
    - Parent and child
    - Root - node that havent parent
    - Leaf - node that have no chilren

    - Binary tree :
        - every node have maximum 2 children
        - exactly ONE root
        - exactly ONE path from root to node

Depth Traverse:
    Using stack(array obj) with stred root within. Then inside loop pop from it node and push value to result arr.
    After this checks if there left or right children and push in to stack

    Using recursion - define function that receive root node as parameter. Then define left and right values by recursively
    invoking this function and in return - form array with root value and left and right variables with spread operator.
