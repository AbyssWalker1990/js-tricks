Graph = nodes + edges(arrows or directions)
Graph can be directed and undirected

DIRECTED:
    Node can have "neighbour" - another node to which we can travel

Example of adjancy list:
{
    a: [b, c],
    b: [d],
    c: [e],
    d: [],
    e: [b],
    f: [d]
}

We can use Depth first and Breadth first traversal to travel across nodes
