Variable:
    A variable is a “named storage” for data. We can use variables to store goodies, visitors, and other data.

var:
    “var” has no block scope
    If a code block is inside a function, then var becomes a function-level variable
    “var” tolerates redeclarations:
        let user;
        let user; // SyntaxError: 'user' has already been declared  
        But
        var user = "Pete";

        var user = "John"; // this "var" does nothing (already declared)
        // ...it doesn't trigger an error

        alert(user); // John

An assignment without use strict
    // note: no "use strict" in this example
    num = 5; // the variable "num" is created if it didn't exist
    alert(num); // 5

    WITH 'use strict'
    "use strict";
    num = 5; // error: num is not defined

TIPS:
// Ways to create IIFE

(function() {
  alert("Parentheses around the function");
})();

(function() {
  alert("Parentheses around the whole thing");
}());

!function() {
  alert("Bitwise NOT operator starts the expression");
}();

+function() {
  alert("Unary plus starts the expression");
}();
