Primitive Data Types:
    is data that is not an object and has no methods or properties. There are 7 primitive data types:
    string, number, bigint, boolean, undefined, symbol, null

String 
    Template literals --- string interpolation
    Wrapper object for using methods. After the use, the wrapper object is disposed
    Difference between slice() and substring():
        These two methods are almost identical, except for a few differences. One of them is that if the first index passed to substring() is greater than the second index, the two arguments are exchanged so that a string is still returned. In the same scenario, the slice() method returns an empty string instead:
    split() have optional second argument for maximum pieces

    Iterator:
    const str = 'The quick red fox jumped over the lazy dog\'s back.';

    const iterator = str[Symbol.iterator]();
    let theChar = iterator.next();

    while (!theChar.done) {
    console.log(theChar.value);
    theChar = iterator.next();
    // Expected output: "T"
    //                  "h"
    //                  "e"
    //                   ...
    }

    String() works with null and undefined, but toString() will raise error
