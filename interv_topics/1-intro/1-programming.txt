HIGH LEVEL LANGUAGES:
    Have strong abstraction. Uses natural language elements. Must be translated with compiler or interpreter.

SCRIPTING LANGUAGES:
    A scripting language is a coding language that offers a method of creating commands that do not require compilation.

Information that anyone enters in a scripting language executes sequentially from the top of the code to the bottom, following any protocols of the scripting language
