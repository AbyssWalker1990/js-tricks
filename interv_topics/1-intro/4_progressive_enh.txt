Progressive Enhancement:
    is when one builds a basic functional web application and progressively adds features to it when required to enhance its functionality.

Graceful Degradation:
    is where a customer is provided with an application with all the features but also makes the user aware of the shortcomings of a product to make the product still usable. So in this practice, the user gets an application that works on all modern browsers to provide a certain level of user experience, but itâ€™ll gradually degrade to a lower level of user experience
