Why it helpful:
- Reduce steps for installing environment and services for project on each local machine
- Much easier to deploy and make no conflicts with many services that running in the same host

What is container:
- Layers of images
- Linux base image (most popular because of small size)
- Application image on top

Difference of images and containers:
  Image is an actual package, that can be moved. Image is not running
  Container actually STARTS app and create environment. App is running 
  Container si a running environment for image

Docker vs Virtual machine
1. Docker using own application layer only, VM using OWN OS kernel layer ad app layer together
2. Docker image is much SMALLER
3. Docker containers starts much faster 
4. VM can be run on any OS, docker hasnt this compatibility. For example we can encounter problems with
linux based images on Windows machine

BASIC COMMANDS:
  docker ps // List of running containers
  docker pull name_of_image // Pulling latest version of image
  docker run name_of_image  // Runs container with this image
  docker run -d name_of_image // Starts container in detached mode and give id
  docker stop id_container  // Stops container
  docker start id_container // Starts container with id
  docker ps -a // Shows history of started and stopped containers and their id
  docker run -p6000:6379 name_of_image // Runs container and binding local PORT 6000 to port 6379 of image
