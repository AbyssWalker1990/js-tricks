• Seiri, or organization (think “sort” in English). Knowing where things are—using 
approaches such as suitable naming—is crucial. You think naming identifiers isn’t 
important? Read on in the following chapters.
• Seiton, or tidiness (think “systematize” in English). There is an old American saying: 
A place for everything, and everything in its place. A piece of code should be where 
you expect to find it—and, if not, you should re-factor to get it there.
• Seiso, or cleaning (think “shine” in English): Keep the workplace free of hanging 
wires, grease, scraps, and waste. What do the authors here say about littering your 
code with comments and commented-out code lines that capture history or wishes for 
the future? Get rid of them.
• Seiketsu, or standardization: The group agrees about how to keep the workplace clean. 
Do you think this book says anything about having a consistent coding style and set of 
practices within the group? Where do those standards come from? Read on.
• Shutsuke, or discipline (self-discipline). This means having the discipline to follow the 
practices and to frequently reflect on one’s work and be willing to change.

Making your code readable is as important as making it executable.

Quality is the result of a million selfless acts of care—not just of any great method that 
descends from the heavens

We are honest about the state of our code because code is never perfect
