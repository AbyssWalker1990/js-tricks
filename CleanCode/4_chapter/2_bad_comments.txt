Comments Do Not Make up For Bad Code
Clear and expressive code with few comments is far superior to cluttered and complex code with lots of comments. 
Rather than spend your time writing the comments that explain the mess you’ve made, spend it cleaning that mess.
---------------------------------------
Explain Yourself in Code
It is better to explain your intention by properly naming classes, functions and variables in good organized code
than explain mess that you wrote

Good Comments
Some comments are necessary or beneﬁcial.

Legal comments
Copyright and authorship statements are necessary and reasonable things to put into a comment at the start of each source ﬁle.

Informative Comments
It is sometimes useful to provide basic information with a comment

Explanation of intent
We can explain WHY we done something

 In general it is better to ﬁnd a way to make that argument or return value clear in its own right
