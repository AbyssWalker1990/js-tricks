Data Abstraction
Don't expose the details of your data. We need to think about better way to represent our data and do not add getters 
and setters blightly
-------------------------------------------
Procedural code (code using data structures) makes it easy to add new functions without changing the existing data structures. 
OO code, on the other hand, makes it easy to add new classes without changing existing functions.

Law of Demeter
More precisely, the Law of Demeter says that a method f of a class C should only call
the methods of these:
• C
• An object created by f
• An object passed as an argument to f
• An object held in an instance variable of C
