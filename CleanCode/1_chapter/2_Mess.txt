"Every change they make to the code breaks two or three other parts of the code. No change is trivial. 
Every addition or modiﬁcation to the system requires that the tangles, twists, and knots be “understood” so 
that more tangles, twists, and knots can be added. Over time the mess becomes so big and so deep and so tall, 
they can not clean it up. There is no way at all"

The Great Redesign in the Sky
The decision of redesign the whole project to get rid off these mess applied.
The new team started to write brand new version of product while the old team still maintain main version and
add new features for it. The new team must implement these new features too. it can take YEARS. And after many years
it can be no longer peoples who started this new project and new programmers starting to say about new REDESIGN 
because of mess

Attitude
Most managers want the truth, even when they don’t act like it. Most managers want good code, even when they are 
obsessing about the schedule. They may defend the schedule and requirements with passion; but that’s their job. 
It’s your job to defend the code with equal passion

The Primal Conundrum
You will not make the deadline by making the mess. Indeed, the mess will slow you down instantly, and will force 
you to miss the deadline. The only way to make the deadline—the only way to go fast—is to keep the code as clean 
as possible at all times

The Art of Clean Code?
Writing clean code requires the disciplined use of a myriad little techniques applied through a painstakingly 
acquired sense of “cleanliness.”
