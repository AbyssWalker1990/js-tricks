SMALL!!!
Functions must be so small as you can do it
--------------------------------------------
Do One Thing
Functions should do one thing. They should do it well. They should do it only
Functions that do one thing cannot be reasonably divided into sections
--------------------------------------------
Reading code from top to bottom. Stepdown rule
--------------------------------------------
Dont use switch statement in functions. Try to use polymorphism and defining it once in object
