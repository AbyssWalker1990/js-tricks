Function is an OBJECT
Ways to create:
  - Function Declaration and Expressions
  - Arrow functions
  - Function constructors
  - Generator functions
-----------------------------------------
Function declaration:
function funkName() {}

Function Expression:
const func = function () {}
// The difference between these methods is that we must give name to func when declare it. For Expression
this is optional,  but it can be used for recursion.
Also Declaration can be invoked before declaring func, Expressions cant!
